  I spent time reading a paper on magnetars. 
  Bibtex:
    @article{ Bruni2021:2105.01440v1,
      author = { G. Bruni and B. O'Connor and T. Matsumoto and E. Troja and T. Piran and L. Piro and R. Ricci },
      title = { Late-time radio observations of the short GRB200522A: constraints on the magnetar model },
      eprint = { Arxiv:2105.01440v1 },
      year = { 2021 },
      url = { http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01440 },
    }
  Thoughts:
    I honestly couldn't tell what the conclusions were as they didn't seem to conclusively say if the GRB was a magnetar or not, but I did learn more about
    techniques related to fitting constraints on theories based on theoretical predictions of magnetars' ejected masses and how much emission there should
    be after a certain amount of time.
    It was also helpful to see another paper on a magnetar and has got me thinking more about what it might look like to be able to study a magnetar.
